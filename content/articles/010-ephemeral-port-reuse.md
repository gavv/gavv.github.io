### Ephemeral ports

The [ephemeral port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port) range is a range of ports used by the kernel when the user wants the socket to be bound to a random unused port.

In particular, `bind`, `listen`, `connect`, and `sendto` may automatically allocate an ephemeral port for AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets. This behavior is described in the `ip_local_port_range` section of the [`ip(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html) man page.

This feature is not specified in POSIX but is available in many operating systems that implement BSD sockets, including Linux.

### Reusing address

Be careful when using `SO_REUSEADDR` and the port is allowed to be ephemeral.

The [`socket(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html) man page states the following:

```
       SO_REUSEADDR
              Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied
              in a bind(2) call should allow reuse of local addresses.  For
              AF_INET sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when
              there is an active listening socket bound to the address.
```

Hence, when an ephemeral port is allocated, `SO_REUSEADDR` enables the kernel to reuse any other non-listening ephemeral port.

The important point here is that the kernel doesn't check whether there is an opened socket for an ephemeral port, it only checks whether there is a socket in the listening state for that port.

This means that the kernel is free to reuse an ephemeral port of any opened UDP socket (because `listen` is not used for datagram sockets) and any opened TCP socket for which `listen` was not called yet.

Note that when some application uses `bind` to allocate an ephemeral port for a TCP socket, and then immediately calls `listen`, there is still a short period of time when the socket is in the non-listening state.

Thus, to prevent the probability of stealing a port of a random running application, take care not to accidentally enable `SO_REUSEADDR` when using ephemeral ports, both for UDP and TCP sockets.

### Test program

I've prepared a small program demonstrating the issue: [`ephemeral_reuse.c`](https://github.com/gavv/snippets/blob/master/net/ephemeral_reuse.c)

The program opens the given number of listening or non-listening UDP or TCP sockets bound to ephemeral ports and checks whether all ports are unique or not. All sockets are kept open until the program exits.

Let's give it a try.

Create 1000 UDP sockets, disable `SO_REUSEADDR`. All ports are unique:

```
$ ./a.out 1000 udp nolisten noreuseaddr
protocol = udp
listen = no
reuseaddr = no
conflicts = 0
```

Create 1000 UDP sockets, enable `SO_REUSEADDR`. An opened port was stealed 21 times:

```
$ ./a.out 1000 udp nolisten reuseaddr
protocol = udp
listen = no
reuseaddr = yes
conflict: port[0102] = port[0122] = 34061
conflict: port[0139] = port[0204] = 36124
conflict: port[0008] = port[0248] = 33533
conflict: port[0020] = port[0286] = 47015
conflict: port[0213] = port[0404] = 50594

conflict: port[0315] = port[0942] = 60800
conflict: port[0230] = port[0998] = 40282
conflicts = 21
```

Create 7100 non-listening TCP sockets, disable `SO_REUSEADDR`. All ports are unique:

```
$ ulimit -n 10000
$ ./a.out 7100 tcp nolisten noreuseaddr
protocol = tcp
listen = no
reuseaddr = no
conflicts = 0
```

Create 7100 listening TCP sockets, enable `SO_REUSEADDR`. All ports are unique:

```
$ ulimit -n 10000
$ ./a.out 7100 tcp listen reuseaddr
protocol = tcp
listen = yes
reuseaddr = yes
conflicts = 0
```

Create 7100 non-listening TCP sockets, enable `SO_REUSEADDR`. An opened port was stealed 42 times:

```
$ ulimit -n 10000
$ ./a.out 7100 tcp nolisten reuseaddr
protocol = tcp
listen = no
