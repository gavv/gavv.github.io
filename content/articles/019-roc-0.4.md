## What's in this release

[Roc Toolkit](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit) implements real-time streaming over unreliable networks like Internet and Wi-Fi, with high quality and low latency.

It can connect audio apps and devices across network, which run PipeWire, PulseAudio, bare ALSA, macOS CoreAudio, and Android. You can use it via [C library](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/api.html), [bindings](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/api/bindings.html), [CLI tools](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/command_line_tools.html), [sound server extensions](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/sound_server_modules.html), and [Android app](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-droid/).

Highlights of the new release:

* Added [Roc VAD](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad) - a virtual device for macOS using [libASPL](https://github.com/gavv/libASPL) (when apps play to device, it streams audio to another machine, which can play it)

* Finished [RTCP & XR](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/internals/network_protocols.html) support and implement two-way report exchange.

* Added latency tuning on sender instead of receiver (for cases when receiver is more CPU-constrained).

* Added [audio file backends](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/internals/audio_backends.html) using libsndfile and dr_wav (for cases when external dependencies are limited).

* Numerous bug-fixes.

* [Portability](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/portability/supported_platforms.html) fixes, including Ubuntu 24.04, macOS 14, OpenWrt/MIPS (all three now added to CI and QA), and Debian GNU/Hurd.

Full changelog is here:

 * [v0.4.0](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/development/changelog.html#version-0-4-0-jun-14-2024)

### Virtual device for macOS

[Roc VAD](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad) implements macOS virtual audio device that automatically streams all sound played by apps to remote peers. (Or receives streams from remote peers and allows apps to capture that).

<a data-lightbox="roc_vad" href="/articles/roc-0.4/roc_vad.png">
  <img src="/articles/roc-0.4/roc_vad.png" width="400px"/>
</a>

E.g. you can configure it to stream sound from Youtube or iTunes to a Raspberry Pi with speakers over Wi-Fi.

Virtual device driver can be controlled from command-line and via gRPC interface. The latter allows you to use it in your own projects.

For further details, refer to the project [README](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad).

### F-Droid

[Roc Droid](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-droid) (our prototype Android app) is now [available on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.rocstreaming.rocdroid/).

It doesn't use 0.4 release yet, but hopefully an update will land soon.

## Migration from 0.3

If you're using [CLI tools](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/command_line_tools.html), you may need to adjust a few options.

We're currently working on an improved latency tuning engine and memory limits, and these changes are a part of preparations for that.

## Linux (PipeWire modules)

### Option 1: Install from packages

PipeWire modules for Roc are part of PipeWire upstream, and your some distros already have them. However you need to ensure that the version from your distro uses `libroc0.4` or higher.

If you're lucky, the installation is simple.

On Debian-based distros, you likely already have Roc modules if you have PipeWire installed (`pipewire-module-roc-sink` and `pipewire-module-roc-source`).

On Fedora, use:

```
$ dnf install pipewire-module-roc
```

On Arch, use:

```
$ pacman -S pipewire-roc
```

On nixOS, use:

```
$ nix-shell -p roc-toolkit
```

### Option 2: Install from sources

Alternatively, you can continue using PipeWire package from your distro, but build latest PipeWire's Roc modules separately, using PipeWire source tree.

First, install build dependencies according to [Roc documentation](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/building/user_cookbook.html).

On Debian-based systems, this command will install all needed dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ pkg-config scons ragel gengetopt \
    libuv1-dev libunwind-dev libspeexdsp-dev libsox-dev libssl-dev libsndfile-dev libpulse-dev \
    libtool intltool autoconf automake make cmake meson git
```

Clone Roc sources:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit.git
```

Build and install Roc:

```
$ cd roc-toolkit
$ scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec
$ sudo scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec install
```

Then install build dependencies according to [PipeWire CI](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml).

On Debian-based systems, this command will install all needed dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install \
    findutils git systemd \
    libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libva-dev libglib2.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
    libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libudev-dev libx11-dev \
    meson ninja-build pkg-config \
    python3-pip python3-docutils
```

Clone PipeWire sources:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire.git
```

Checkout version which is used on your system:

```
$ cd pipewire
$ git checkout $(pipewire --version | grep -Eo '[0-9.]+' | head -1)
```

Build PipeWire and all modules:

```
$ meson setup builddir
$ meson configure builddir -Dprefix=/usr
$ meson compile -C builddir
```

Install Roc modules into the system:

```
$ sudo cp builddir/src/modules/libpipewire-module-roc-sink.so <PIPEWIRE_MODULE_DIR>/
$ sudo cp builddir/src/modules/libpipewire-module-roc-source.so <PIPEWIRE_MODULE_DIR>/
```

For example, on Debian-based x86_64 systems with PipeWire 0.3.x, **`PIPEWIRE_MODULE_DIR`** is **`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pipewire-0.3`**.

### Configure PipeWire sink (Roc sender)

[**→ Full documentation**](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_module_roc_sink.html)

Perform this step if you want to **send** sound from your computer to remote Roc receivers, for example, to send sound from a browser or an audio player to a Raspberry Pi board with speakers.

First, ensure that you have pipewire configuration directory:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
```

Then, create **`~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/roc-sink.conf`** and add the following:

```
context.modules = [
  {   name = libpipewire-module-roc-sink
      args = {
          fec.code = rs8m
          remote.ip = <IP>
          remote.source.port = 10001
          remote.repair.port = 10002
          sink.name = "Roc Sink"
          sink.props = {
             node.name = "roc-sink"
          }
      }
  }
]
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the IP address of the Roc receiver.

Then restart PipeWire:

```
$ systemctl restart --user pipewire.service
```

Now you should see Roc Source in the list of loaded modules:

```
$ pw-cli ls Module
	...
	id 29, type PipeWire:Interface:Module/3
 		object.serial = "29"
 		module.name = "libpipewire-module-roc-sink"
```

After doing this, if you select "ROC Sink" as the output device, sound written to it will be send to remote Roc receiver.

### Configure PipeWire source (Roc receiver)

[**→ Full documentation**](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_module_roc_source.html)

Perform this step if you want to **receive** sound from remote Roc senders, for example from a Roc sink on another computer, and play it on your computer.

First, ensure that you have pipewire configuration directory:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
```

Then, create **`~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/roc-source.conf`** and add the following:

```
context.modules = [
  {   name = libpipewire-module-roc-source
      args = {
          local.ip = 0.0.0.0
          resampler.profile = medium
          fec.code = rs8m
          sess.latency.msec = 100
          local.source.port = 10001
          local.repair.port = 10002
          source.name = "Roc Source"
          source.props = {
             node.name = "roc-source"
          }
      }
  }
]
```

Then restart PipeWire:

```
$ systemctl restart --user pipewire.service
```

Now you should see Roc Source in the list of loaded modules:

```
$ pw-cli ls Module
	...
	id 28, type PipeWire:Interface:Module/3
 		object.serial = "28"
 		module.name = "libpipewire-module-roc-source"
```

After doing this, if remote Roc sender will send samples to your computer, it will be played.

## Linux (PulseAudio modules)

[**→ Full documentation**](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-pulse)

### Install dependencies

On Debian-based systems, this command will install all needed dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt install -y \
    gcc g++ make libtool intltool m4 autoconf automake \
    meson libsndfile-dev cmake scons git wget python3 \
    pulseaudio
```

### Clone, build, install

These commands will automatically download and build libroc, build PulseAudio modules, and install them into the system.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-pulse.git
$ cd roc-pulse
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Configure PulseAudio sink (Roc sender)

Perform this step if you want to **send** sound from your computer to remote Roc receivers, for example, to send sound from a browser or an audio player to a Raspberry Pi board with speakers.

For every remote receiver, e.g. for every Raspberry Pi board running roc-recv, add the following line to **`/etc/pulse/default.pa`**:

```
load-module module-roc-sink remote_ip=<IP> sink_properties=device.description=<NAME>
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the IP address of the Roc receiver, and **`<NAME>`** is a human-readable name that will be displayed in the PulseAudio GUI.

For example:

```
load-module module-roc-sink remote_ip=192.168.0.100 sink_properties=device.description=Raspberry
```

This will create a PulseAudio sink that sends all sound written to it to a specific Roc receiver. Local applications like browsers and audio players can then be connected to this sink using usual PulseAudio GUIs like pavucontrol.

Restart PulseAudio:

```
$ pulseaudio --kill
$ pulseaudio --start
```

### Configure PulseAudio sink-input (Roc receiver)

Perform this step if you want to **receive** sound from remote Roc senders, for example from a Roc sink on another computer, and play it on your computer.

Add the following line to **`/etc/pulse/default.pa`**:

```
load-module module-roc-sink-input sink_input_properties=media.name=<NAME>
```

Here, **`<NAME>`** is a human-readable name that will be displayed in the PulseAudio GUI.

For example:

```
load-module module-roc-sink-input sink_input_properties=media.name=Roc
```

This will create a PulseAudio sink-input that receives the sound from arbitrary Roc senders and writes it to a local sink. This sink-input can then be connected to a sink, typically a sound card, using usual PulseAudio GUIs like pavucontrol.

Restart PulseAudio:

```
$ pulseaudio --kill
$ pulseaudio --start
```

### Using pavucontrol

Here is how you can connect VLC player to a Roc **sink** named "Raspberry" (which sends sound to a Raspberry Pi board) using pavucontrol tool:

<img src="/articles/roc-tutorial/pavucontrol_roc_sink.png" width="680px"
    style="border: solid 1px; border-color: #bebab0;"/>

And here is how you can connect Roc **sink-input** named "Roc" (which receives sound from remote Roc sinks) to a specific local sound card:

<img src="/articles/roc-tutorial/pavucontrol_roc_sink_input.png" width="680px"
    style="border: solid 1px; border-color: #bebab0;"/>

## Linux (bare ALSA)

Full documentation: [**→ how to build**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/building/user_cookbook.html), [**→ how to run**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/command_line_tools.html), [**→ manual pages**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/manuals.html)

### Install dependencies

First, install build dependencies. On Debian-based systems, you can use this command:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ pkg-config scons ragel gengetopt \
    libuv1-dev libunwind-dev libspeexdsp-dev libsox-dev libssl-dev libsndfile-dev libpulse-dev \
    libtool intltool autoconf automake make cmake meson git
```

### Clone, build, install

Clone Roc sources:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit.git
```

Build and install Roc library and tools:

```
$ cd roc-toolkit
$ scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec
$ sudo scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec install
```

Now you should have `roc-send` and `roc-recv` tools in PATH.

### Run roc-send (Roc sender)

Perform this step if you want to **send** sound played on your Raspberry Pi board to a remote Roc receiver, for example to a Roc sink-input on another computer.

Configure a loopback ALSA device in **`/etc/asound.conf`**:

```
pcm.aloop {
   type hw
   card 2
}

ctl.aloop {
   type hw
   card 2
}

defaults.pcm.card 2
defaults.ctl.card 2
```

Then load the loopback module:

```
$ sudo modprobe snd-aloop
```

Run sender:

```
$ roc-send -vv \
    -s rtp+rs8m://<IP>:10001 -r rs8m://<IP>:10002 -c rtcp://<IP>:10003 \
    -i alsa://plughw:CARD=Loopback,DEV=1
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the destination IP address running Roc receiver, for example, another computer running Roc receiver.

Note that the exact ALSA device name can be different. You can get the name by running `aplay -L` and searching for "Loopback" entries.

If you want to automatically start `roc-send` on boot, and you're using systemd, create **`/etc/systemd/system/roc-send.service`** with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=roc-send
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/roc-send -vv -s rtp+rs8m://<IP>:10001 -r rs8m://<IP>:10002 -c rtcp://<IP>:10003 -i alsa://<DEVICE>
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run:

```
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable --now roc-send.service
```

You also need to add snd-aloop to **`/etc/modules`**:

```
snd-aloop
```

### Run roc-recv (Roc receiver)

Perform this step if you want to **receive** sound from remote Roc senders, for example from a Roc sink on another computer, and play it on your Raspberry Pi board.

Run receiver:

```
$ roc-recv -vv \
    -s rtp+rs8m://0.0.0.0:10001 -r rs8m://0.0.0.0:10002 -c rtcp://0.0.0.0:10003 \
    -o alsa://default
```

Instead of `alsa://default`, you can use `alsa://<DEVICE>`, where `DEVICE` is one of the names printed by `aplay -l`, e.g. `hw:0`.

If you want to automatically start `roc-recv` on boot, and you're using systemd, create **`/etc/systemd/system/roc-recv.service`** with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=roc-recv
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/roc-recv -vv -s rtp+rs8m://0.0.0.0:10001 -r rs8m://0.0.0.0:10002 -c rtcp://0.0.0.0:10003
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run:

```
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable --now roc-recv.service
```

## Cross-compile to Raspberry Pi (PulseAudio modules)

The following instructions are suitable for Raspberry Pi 2 and later. If you're using another board, consult the [User cookbook](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/building/user_cookbook.html)  and [Cross-compiling](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/portability/cross_compiling.html) pages from the documentation.

These instructions assume that you want to use Docker to get a pre-packaged (binary) toolchain for cross-compiling. If you want to prepare the toolchain manually, consult the documentation above.

These instructions also assume that you're using **PulseAudio on your board**. If you're using bare ALSA instead, jump to the [next section](#cross-compile-to-raspberry-pi-bare-alsa).

### Are you running 32-bit or 64-bit OS on Raspberry?

On your Raspberry board, both CPU and OS may be either 32-bit or 64-bit. What is important is the bitness of OS. If you're not sure, run:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ uname -m
```

on your board. If the output is `aarch64`, the the OS is 64-bit. If the output is `arm*` then it's 32-bit.

### Which PulseAudio version are you running on Raspberry?

It's important to build Roc PulseAudio modules against exactly same version of PulseAudio which is running on your board. If you're not sure, run:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pulseaudio --version
```

### Install dependencies on Raspberry

To install runtime Roc dependencies, **ssh** to the board and run apt-get:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install libasound2 libpulse0 libltdl7
```

### Install Docker on desktop machine

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker from the upstream repo.

If you're running Ubuntu on your desktop, you can also install Docker packaged by distro:

```
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

### Cross-compile Roc PulseAudio modules on desktop machine (for 64-bit Raspberry)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-pulse.git
$ cd roc-pulse
$ docker run -t --rm -u "${UID}" -v "${PWD}:${PWD}" -w "${PWD}" \
    rocstreaming/toolchain-aarch64-linux-gnu:gcc-7.4 \
        env TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=aarch64-linux-gnu PULSEAUDIO_VERSION=<???> make
```

You should replace `<???>` with the exact version of PulseAudio which you're using on your Raspberry Pi board, for example `15.99.1`.

### Cross-compile Roc PulseAudio modules on desktop machine (for 32-bit Raspberry)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-pulse.git
$ cd roc-pulse
$ docker run -t --rm -u "${UID}" -v "${PWD}:${PWD}" -w "${PWD}" \
    rocstreaming/toolchain-arm-linux-gnueabihf:gcc-4.9 \
        env TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-linux-gnueabihf PULSEAUDIO_VERSION=<???> make
```

You should replace `<???>` with the exact version of PulseAudio which you're using on your Raspberry Pi board, for example `15.99.1`.

### Install Roc PulseAudio modules to Raspberry

Copy command-line tools to the board via ssh:

```
$ scp ./bin/module-roc-*.so <IP>:/usr/lib/pulse-<PULSE_VER>/modules/
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi board, and **`<PULSE_VER>`** is the version of PulseAudio which you're using on your Raspberry Pi board, for example `15.99.1`.

### Configuring sender or receiver

Now you can **ssh** to you board and follow instructions from section "Linux (PulseAudio modules)":

* [Configure PulseAudio sink (Roc sender)](#configure-pulseaudio-sink-roc-sender)
* [Configure PulseAudio sink-input (Roc receiver)](#configure-pulseaudio-sink-input-roc-receiver)

---

## Cross-compile to Raspberry Pi (bare ALSA)

The following instructions are suitable for Raspberry Pi 2 and later. If you're using another board, consult the [User cookbook](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/building/user_cookbook.html)  and [Cross-compiling](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/portability/cross_compiling.html) pages from the documentation.

These instructions assume that you want to use Docker to get a pre-packaged (binary) toolchain for cross-compiling. If you want to prepare the toolchain manually, consult the documentation above.

These instructions also assume that you're using **bare ALSA** (without PulseAudio) **on your board**. If you're using PulseAudio instead, consult the [previous section](#cross-compile-to-raspberry-pi-pulseaudio-modules).

### Are you running 32-bit or 64-bit OS on Raspberry?

On your Raspberry board, both CPU and OS may be either 32-bit or 64-bit. What is important is the bitness of OS. If you're not sure, run:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ uname -m
```

on your board. If the output is `aarch64`, the the OS is 64-bit. If the output is `arm*` then it's 32-bit.

### Install dependencies on Raspberry

To install runtime Roc dependencies, **ssh** to the board and run apt-get:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install libasound2
```

### Install Docker on desktop machine

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker from the upstream repo.

If you're running Ubuntu on your desktop, you can also install Docker packaged by distro:

```
$ sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

### Cross-compile Roc tools on desktop machine (for 64-bit Raspberry)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit.git
$ cd roc-toolkit
$ docker run -t --rm -u "${UID}" -v "${PWD}:${PWD}" -w "${PWD}" \
    rocstreaming/toolchain-aarch64-linux-gnu:gcc-7.4 \
      scons -Q \
        --host=aarch64-linux-gnu \
        --build-3rdparty=all \
        --disable-pulseaudio
```

### Cross-compile Roc tools on desktop machine (for 32-bit Raspberry)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit.git
$ cd roc-toolkit
$ docker run -t --rm -u "${UID}" -v "${PWD}:${PWD}" -w "${PWD}" \
    rocstreaming/toolchain-arm-linux-gnueabihf:gcc-4.9 \
      scons -Q \
        --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf \
        --build-3rdparty=all \
        --disable-pulseaudio
```

### Install Roc tools (to 64-bit Raspberry)

Copy command-line tools to the board via ssh:

```
$ scp ./bin/aarch64-linux-gnu/roc-{recv,send} <IP>:/usr/bin
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi board.

### Install Roc tools (to 32-bit Raspberry)

Copy command-line tools to the board via ssh:

```
$ scp ./bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf/roc-{recv,send} <IP>:/usr/bin
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi board.

### Configuring sender or receiver

Now you can **ssh** to you board and follow instructions from section "Linux (bare ALSA)":

* [Run roc-send (Roc sender)](#run-roc-send-roc-sender)
* [Run roc-recv (Roc receiver)](#run-roc-recv-roc-receiver)

---

## macOS (virtual device)

[**→ Full documentation**](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad)

These instructions assume that you want to use `roc-vad` to create virtual audio devices: virtual speaker or virtual microphone.

### Option 1: install from binaries

This will install driver and command-line tool:

```
$ sudo /bin/bash -c \
  "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After running the command, you need to **reboot your Mac**.

### Option 2: install from sources

Prepare environment:

* install Xcode Command Line Tools ([instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)) or Xcode (from App Store)
* install Homebrew ([instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2018/03/07/how-install-homebrew-mac-os/))
* install Git ([instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git))

Install build dependencies:

```
$ brew install cmake scons autoconf automake pkg-config libtool go
```

Clone repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-vad.git
```

Build and install:

```
$ cd roc-vad
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Now you need to **reboot your Mac**.

### Check driver

After rebooting, check that driver is loaded and running:

```
$ roc-vad info
driver is loaded

driver:
  version: 0.0.1
  commit:  76ca125

client:
  version: 0.0.1
  commit:  76ca125
```

### Configure virtual speakers (Roc sender)

If you want to **stream from macOS** to remote receiver, create virtual speakers:

```
$ roc-vad device add sender
device #1

  type:   sender
  uid:    aba744-43a201-c27dff-4de630
  name:   Roc Virtual Device #1
  state:  on

  ...
```

Check that the created device is present:

```
$ roc-vad device list
index    type       state   uid                            name
1        sender     on      aba744-43a201-c27dff-4de630    Roc Virtual Device #1
```

After creating sender device, you can connect it to remote receiver. Usually you need to connect three endpoints: source packets (audio traffic), repair packets (for loss recovery), and control packets (for latency tuning).

E.g. if local sender device has index "1" and remote receiver is running at 192.168.0.1 and uses three ports 10001, 10002, and 10003 for source, repair, and control endpoints, then run:

```
$ roc-vad device connect 1 \
   --source rtp+rs8m://192.168.0.1:10001 \
   --repair rs8m://192.168.0.1:10002 \
   --control rtcp://192.168.0.1:10003
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audiosrc
  uri:        rtp+rs8m://192.168.0.1:10001
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audiorpr
  uri:        rs8m://192.168.0.1:10002
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audioctl
  uri:        rtcp://192.168.0.1:10003
```

Now, applications play audio to `Roc Virtual Device #1`, the sound is streamed to the remote receiver. If there are multiple applications, the streams are mixed.

> Note that the sound written to sender device is not heard locally. If you need it, you can use third-party software like [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) to create a loopback from sender device to local speakers.

### Configure virtual microphone (Roc receiver)

If you want to **stream to macOS** from a remote sender, create virtual microphone:

```
$ roc-vad device add receiver
device #2

  type:   receiver
  uid:    934855-95c5ca-9841c4-645f85
  name:   Roc Virtual Device #2
  state:  on

  ...
```

Check that device is present:

```
$ roc-vad device list
index    type       state   uid                            name
1        sender     on      aba744-43a201-c27dff-4de630    Roc Virtual Device #1
2        receiver   on      934855-95c5ca-9841c4-645f85    Roc Virtual Device #2
```

After creating receiver device, you can bind it to local endpoints. Usually you need to bind three endpoints: source packets (audio traffic), repair packets (for loss recovery), and control packets (for latency tuning).

E.g. if receiver device has index "2" and you want to use three ports 10001, 10002, and 10003 for source, repair, and control endpoints, then run:

```
$ roc-vad device bind 2 \
   --source rtp+rs8m://0.0.0.0:10001 \
   --repair rs8m://0.0.0.0:10002 \
   --control rtcp://0.0.0.0:10003
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audiosrc
  uri:        rtp+rs8m://0.0.0.0:10001
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audiorpr
  uri:        rs8m://0.0.0.0:10002
endpoint:
  slot:       0
  interface:  audioctl
  uri:        rtcp://0.0.0.0:10003
```

Now, applications that records audio from `Roc Virtual Device #2` gets the sound streamed to receiver from remote senders. If there are multiple senders, the streams are mixed.

> Note that the sound sent to receiver device is not heard locally. Receiver device acts as a virtual microphone for other applications, not as a player for received sound. If you need it, you can use third-party software like [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) to create a loopback from receiver device to local speakers. Or don't use virtual device at all and just use `roc-recv` CLI tool as described [below](#macos-cli-tools).

### Persistence

All created devices and all their settings (including bound and connected endpoints) are stored persistently. If you restart audio server or reboot, roc-vad will recreate them.

If you want to disable device temporarily without losing its configuration, you can use `disable` and `enable` commands:

```
$ roc-vad device disable 1
disabled device with index 1
```

```
$ roc-vad device enable 1
enabled device with index 1
```

If you want to remove device permanently, use `del` command:

```
$ roc-vad device del 1
deleted device with index 1
```

### Uninstallation

To uninstall driver and tool from your machine, run:

```
$ sudo roc-vad uninstall
```

If you've installed from source, you can alternatively run:

```
sudo make uninstall
```

After that, you need to **reboot your Mac**.

## macOS (CLI tools)

Full documentation: [**→ how to build**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/building/user_cookbook.html), [**→ how to run**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/command_line_tools.html), [**→ manual pages**](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/manuals.html)

These instructions assume that you want to use `roc-recv` or `roc-send` CLI tools directly, without creating virtual audio devices.

### Prepare environment

* install Xcode Command Line Tools ([instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)) or Xcode (from App Store)
* install Homebrew ([instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2018/03/07/how-install-homebrew-mac-os/))
* install Git ([instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git))

### Install dependencies

```
$ brew install libtool autoconf automake make cmake \
    pkg-config scons ragel gengetopt libuv speexdsp sox libsndfile openssl@3
```

### Clone, build, install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit.git
$ cd roc-toolkit
$ scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec PKG_CONFIG=`brew --prefix`/bin/pkg-config
$ sudo scons -Q --build-3rdparty=openfec PKG_CONFIG=`brew --prefix`/bin/pkg-config install
```

### Run roc-send (Roc sender)

If you want to **send** sound played on your macOS from a microphone to a remote Roc receiver, for example to a Raspberry Pi box, run roc-send:

```
$ roc-send -vv -s rtp+rs8m://<IP>:10001 -r rs8m://<IP>:10002 -c rtcp://<IP>:10003 -i "core://default"
```

Here, **`<IP>`** is the destination IP address running Roc receiver. 

Instead of `core://default`, you can use `core://<DEVICE>`, where `DEVICE` is one of the names printed by `system_profiler SPAudioDataType`.

### Run roc-recv (Roc receiver)

If you want to **receive** sound from remote Roc senders, for example from a Roc sink on another computer and play it on your macOS computer, run roc-recv:

```
$ roc-recv -vv -s rtp+rs8m://0.0.0.0:10001 -r rs8m://0.0.0.0:10002 -c rtcp://0.0.0.0:10003
```

## Android app

To run Roc receiver and sender on Android device, you can use our prototype app [Roc Droid](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-droid/).

You can install it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.rocstreaming.rocdroid/), [IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.rocstreaming.rocdroid), or download prebuilt APK for [latest release](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-droid/releases). You can also build it from source by following instructions in README.

The app can work in two modes:

* receive sound from remote Roc sender, and play it on Android
* grab sound, either from currently playing Android apps, or from microphone, and send it to remote Roc receiver

## Troubleshooting

### Check sound

Before running Roc tools on Raspberry that uses bare ALSA, ensure that sound is working on your board using `aplay` or `arecord`. Other useful commands are `alsamixer` and `alsactl init`, but their usage it out of the scope of this tutorial.

If Raspberry uses PulseAudio or PipeWire, ensure that the daemon is running, `pactl` shows expected devices, and you can play or capture audio using `paplay` and `parec` (or `pw-play` and `pw-record`).

Also make sure that Roc CLI tool or module is connected to the right source or sink. E.g. for PulseAudio you may need to use `pactl move-sink-input`.

### Check network

When you run Roc sender and Roc receiver, you should see information about connected sender in receiver's logs and vice versa. If you don't, it indicates problems with network connection, e.g. you used incorrect address or port.

### Obtain logs

Command-line tools write logs to standard output, if you specify `-vv` option. If you're using systemd to run them, logs can be seen using `journalctl`.

To see logs from PulseAudio modules, you can disable pulseaudio via systemd and run daemon manually in terminal using `pulseaudio -vvv` command. Alternatively, you can enable verbose logs in pulseaudio config and use `journalctl`.

### Sound server

Remember that PulseAudio and PipeWire typically run as user, so you need `--user` flag for `systemctl` and `journalctl`.

Also be aware that systemd may unload all user services when you're not logged in (e.g. you're running headless Raspberry and have no active ssh sessions). You may need to [enable lingering](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/585891) to prevent this.

### Virtual devices

If virtual devices are not shown on mac, you can try disabling (`roc-vad device disable`) and re-enabling (`roc-vad device enable`) device, or rebooting computer.

### Broken playback

If you hear frequent stuttering, try increasing `target_latency`, `io_latency`, and `latency_tolerance` parameters (names may slightly vary for CLI tools and sound server modules)

If you hear awful loud noises, make sure that `packet_encoding` and `fec_encoding` match on sender and receiver.
